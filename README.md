# Global apparent temperature and heat wave toolbox

High-quality apparent temperature data are urgently needed for the further research on human–environment interactions. 

Using ERA5 hourly data on single levels of 2 m temperature, wind speed, dewpoint temperature and solar radiation, we developed a global apparent temperature and heat wave (GATHW) toolbox based on the Climate Data Store (CDS) online platform. 

This toolbox allows using three methods to calculate daily apparent temperature and heat wave at three spatial resolutions of 0.25°, 0.5° and 1° respectively. 

It can realize online calculation, display and real-time download and is updated in near real-time.
